# Type safety

## Typescript

- We use Typescript on API + ⚛️ frontend
- Gives us confidence in major rewrites
- Whenever we try to circumvent our type system, we see errors emerge

## GraphQL code generator

- Generates types and functions based on our GraphQL schema
- We generate types on API + client
- It allow schema updates and Typescript will tell us what breaks
- It turns out we’re horrible at reading our schema and guessing types 🤦‍♂️

## Demo 👨‍💻
