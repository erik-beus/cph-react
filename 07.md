# Type safety

## Typescript

- We use Typescript on our API and our React frontend
- Gives us confidence in major rewrites
- Whenever we try to circumvent our type system, we see errors emerge

## GraphQL code generator

- Generates types and functions based on our GraphQL schema
- We generate types on both client and API
- It allow us to update our schema and let Typescript tell us what breaks
- It turns out we’re horrible at reading our schema and guessing types
