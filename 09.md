# Preview environments

- A full (functional) environment for each PR
- We/developers are lazy! In order to test without a preview environment we previously had to
  1. Check out a branch
  2. Install dependencies
  3. Run database migrations
  4. Potentially configure database to support a test case
  5. Start testing
- With a preview environment we have to
  1. Click a link
  2. Test
- This change means
  - We get to test things in a production-like environment
  - We catch most bugs before they hit production
