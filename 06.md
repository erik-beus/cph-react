# Error reporting

- We use Sentry heavily to detect both API and client side errors
- We address issues quickly and filter them to avoid issue overflow
- Allows us to spot regressions and know which release/PR caused a certain issue
- Issues from preview environments are also reported and must be addressed before merge
