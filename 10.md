# Test processes

- Cypress E2E tests on every PR and before release
- Developers are encouraged to test thoroughly
- PR template for what was changed, and how to test
- Keep PRs small and easy to test
- Release often and early

### _Knowing that there are no manual QA steps between a PR and production, means that we are more thorough when testing our own and our teammates' PRs_
