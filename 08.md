# Feature flags 🚩

We use **_LaunchDarkly_** to manage feature flags (BaaS)

- Release and test unfinished features
- Manage features for custom segments
  - A specific customer
  - A team or a role in Cylindo
  - All internal users
- Replace entire sections of app and try it out on a subset of users
- Merge PRs before they become stale and expensive to maintain
- Manage features on specific environments (some services are not available on our preview environments)
- Requires maintenance/cleanup and discipline to use
- Replace the entire application with a Rick Ashley video for our product manager only
