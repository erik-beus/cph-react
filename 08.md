# Preview environments

- A full environment for each PR
- We/developers are lazy! Without preview environment:
  1. Check out a branch
  2. Install dependencies
  3. Run database migrations
  4. Potentially configure database to support a test case
  5. Start testing
- With preview environment:
  1. Click a link
  2. Test
- This change means
  - We get to test things in a production-like environment
  - We catch most bugs before they hit production

### _Knowing that there are no manual QA steps between a PR and production, means that we are more thorough when testing our own and our teammates' PRs_
